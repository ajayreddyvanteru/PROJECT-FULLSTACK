<p>
    <h2>Required Knowledge</h2></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
    To learn the Python programming language, you do not need any previous programming knowledge. Nevertheless, a basic understanding of any other programming languages ​​will help you understand Python programming concepts quickly.<br>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Python Example</h2></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
    A quick look at the example of Hello, World! In Python programming, and a detailed description is given in the Python Basics page.<br>
    Example:<br>
    print "Hello, World!"<br><br>
    Python 3 requires adding brackets around the value to be printed:<br>
    print ("Hello, World!")<br><br>
    Output:<br>
    Hello, World!<br>

    <h2>Python Overview</h2></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
    Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with high-level programming capabilities It has become famous because of its apparent and easily understandable syntax, portability, and easy to learn.<br><br>
    Python is a programming language that includes features of C and Java. It provides the style of writing an elegant code like C, and for object-oriented programming, it offers classes and objects like Java.<br><br>
    In Python, the program to add two numbers will be as follows:<br><br>
    Example:<br>
    #program to add two numbers in python<br>
a = b = 20 #declare two variables and store 20 into them<br>
print (a+b) #final output<br>
output:<br>
40

    <h2>Some Facts About Python</h2></p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
    1) Python was developed in the late eighties, i.e., the late 1980's by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands as a successor of ABC language capable of exception handling and interfacing.<br>
2) Python is derived from programming languages such as ABC, Modula 3, small talk, Algol-68.<br>
3) Van Rossum picked the name Python for the new language from a TV show, Monty Python's Flying Circus.<br>
4) Python page is a file with a .py extension that contains could be the combination of HTML Tags and Python scripts.<br>
5) In December 1989, the creator developed the 1st python interpreter as a hobby, and then on 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features.<br>
6) On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and included new features.<br>
7) Python is an open-source scripting language.<br>
8) Python is open-source, which means that anyone can download it freely from www.python.org and use it to develop programs. Its source code can be accessed and modified as required in the project.<br>
9) Python is one of the official languages at Google.<br>
